# RoosterTeeth-dl
A Rooster Teeth download manager. This program is a cross-platform GUI in QT for fetching, managing, and downloading RoosterTeeth site content (For those with FIRST membership). The goal of the project is to fill a gap in the RT ecosystem of being able to play content at full quality on your own media player, not having to deal with the many site problems, as well as personal locally self-hosted or archiving applications.
